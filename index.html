                        When did tacos first appeard in the United States?
                    </summary>:
                    <p>
                        The Taco was first introduced to the United States in <time datetime="1905">1905</time>. Mexican migrants were coming in to work on railroads and other jobs and started to bring their delicious food with them.
                        
                        Tacos were essentially a street food at this time since they were highly portable and cheap. In fact, Americans first became exposed to tacos through Mexican food carts in Los Angeles that were run by women called ‚Äúchili queens‚Äù.
                        These ladies sold delicious economic Mexican food like soft corn tortilla tacos, and they were deemed exotic by any American that tried one. The fillings were incredibly spicy and unfamiliar to the American palate.

                        When did Americans started to change their food?
                    </summary>:
                    <p>
                        By <time datetime="1920">1920</time>, the food Mexican immigrants brought in started to fuse with American ingredients.Organs were replaced with the more palatable ground beef and chicken. Cheddar cheese, cool lettuce, tomato became standard fillings. This became known as the ultimate taco to Americans whose traditional cuisine favored more subtle flavors.
                        
                        In short, the taco was becoming something of a Mexican-American fusion. Things got even more interesting when Taco Bell became mainstream and created a breed of ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù food that wasn‚Äôt authentically Mexican at all.
                        
                        The Best Taco‚Ä¶ Wasn‚Äôt Even Called a Taco Did you know that Taco Bell‚Äôs Founder, Glen Bell, found that ‚Äútaco‚Äù was actually a word that Mexicans didn‚Äôt use to describe the meal? Instead, Mexicans used other words to describe tacos that varied by region and local culture.
                        
                        ‚ÄúTaco‚Äù was a word that Mexicans would use toward Americans to identify the dish. This is much like how the Korean food chain Bon Chon calls their ‚Äúegg rolls‚Äù ‚Äúpotstickers‚Äù on their mainstream menu but the dish is properly called ‚Äúmandu‚Äù among Koreans.

                        When did americans decided to pre-fry taco?
                    </summary>:
                    <p>
                        The pre-fried u-shaped taco shell we love didn‚Äôt come into existence until the <time datetime="1940">1940</time>. Mexicans patented this idea first to expedite the taco-making process. Taco Bell took this idea 10 years later to streamline their operations.
                        
                        Previously, tacos were cooked to order and were just soft tacos. The pre-made crunchy taco shell made it easier to mass-produce the taco in America.
